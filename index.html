        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was estabilished in 1538</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">In 1538 Richard and Elizabeth Codington sold the manor of Cuddington to Henry VIII, who started building Nonsuch Palace. Henry VIII wiped away the old village of Cuddington including the old manor/mansion house and the church when he started work on Nonsuch Palace and created two parks – The Great Park and The Little Park. The Great Park was to the west of modern day London Road and covered about 911 acres – much of what is today Stoneleigh and Worcester Park. The Little Park was about 671 acres and was to the east of modern day London Road, covering what is today the land between Ewell and Cheam (including of course, modern day Nonsuch Park). The total area of the palace grounds was not just limited to the manor of Cuddington as Henry acquired about 150 acres each from the Manors of Ewell and from Malden.

        <p class="text-muted">The Library is situated on the first floor of the new building of the school.  It is a welcoming and spacious environment with ample shelving, seating areas for comfort and for study, an IT area, a careers section and a private study room. The library promotes reading for pleasure and provides relevant resources and information that supports learning across the curriculum. 

          There are over 15,000 resources, incorporating fiction, non-fiction, online resources and periodicals together with a growing selection of e-books.  The library also subscribes to The Day which is a current affairs and daily news website as well as JSTOR, an online academic database.</p>

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was estabilished in 1909</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">The Excelsior Scottish Rite Temple, also known as the Samuel French House, White Mansion, Dungarven, and Hurley Mansion, has a fascinating history. Earlier inhabitants of the Mansion include Samuel French (of Smith Kline and French Co.) and Edward Collings Knight, Sr., inventor of the Pullman sleeping car for railroads. Mr. Knight was a descendant of the Collings family for whom the borough and Knight Park are named. Dr. William Albert Davis, of Cooper Hospital in Camden and a 32nd Degree Mason, operated a maternity hospital in the White Mansion. In 1909, William Hurley, owner of a successful chain of furniture stores, purchased the estate and named it in honor of his birthplace, Dungarven, in County Waterford, Ireland.

          The property was purchased by the Excelsior Scottish Rite in 1930 for $125,000 from the estate of William Hurley. In 2003, the Borough of Collingswood entered a 50-year lease of the building owned by the Scottish Rite Freemasons. The Borough appointed the management of the venue to the Collingswood Foundation for the Arts, a registered 501(c)3. Since 2003, many repairs, renovations, and improvements have been made to the mansion, auditorium, and ballroom, all the while preserving its historic charm. During the past 19 years, more than a million guests have visited this classic venue</p>

        <p>Tackling the climate crisis requires all countries to make bold pledges under the Paris Agreement, or NDCs, to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming and strengthen adaptation to its impacts. The Climate Promise is our commitment to ensure that any country wishing to increase the ambition of their national climate pledge is able to do so.

          UNDP is now scaling up its support for countries to turn their NDC targets into concrete action  while continuing to push for greater ambition.</p>

        <p>A science fair is an opportunity for students to do an independent science project following either the scientific method or the engineering design process. Students conduct their research then present their results at a science fair. Science fairs occur at different levels including classroom, school-wide, regional, state, and international. Typically students present their science projects to other students, teachers, and sometimes families at the lower levels. At higher level science fairs, students also present their projects to judges and prizes are awarded for the best science projects. Our directory of science fairs can help you find regional, state, and international science competitions in your area.

          If you are interested in competing at advanced science competitions, our Advanced Project Guide, includes tips for success, how to get started in advanced research, finding a mentor, and much more.</p>
